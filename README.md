# LegacyData
A PowerShell module to simplify dealing with certain legacy data formats, mainly dBASE, FoxPro and Excel

# Situation Report
This is a migration of an older project called "Ashdar.data". 

The goals are:
1. Break this code out of a monsterous, monolithic project with roots dating back ten years.
1. Adopt a more modern approach to deploying a module
1. Provide code that someone in the wider world else might find useful

I believe that none of this code is encumbered. If you diagree, let me know.
