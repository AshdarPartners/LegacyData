# LegacyData
A PowerShell module to simplify dealing with certain legacy data formats, mainly dBASE, FoxPro and Excel

# Situation Report
This is a migration of an older project called "Ashdar.data". 

The goals are:
1. Break this code out of a monstrous, monolithic project with roots dating back ten years, which contains several other *entirely* unrelated things.
1. Adopt a more modern approach to deploying a module
1. Provide code that someone in the wider world else might find useful

# Licensing
I believe that none of this code is encumbered. If you diagree, let me know. 


# Recent Work
When it comes to RDBMS, I am a SQL Server person. 

While I used this code in a relatively superfical way in the distant past, for the last couple of years I have been working with FoxPro data in a more exacting way. This data is mainly managed by FoxPro (for DOS), not Visual FoxPro (for Windows). Visual FoxPro seems leaps and bounds better than FoxPro (for DOS), but we can't always choose what we need to work with. I've been spoiled by modern RDBMS and I am often confounded by FoxPro's quirks.
