This module contains functions that provide simple functions written for ODBC, 
ADO and OLEDB. OLEDB is the best supported. 

ADO still lurks around because it is not worth removing it.

In the tests that I have run, OLEDB is more efficient than the ADO driver.

You can use these to interact with databases that provide a suitable driver. These 
functions have seen action against FoxPro, dBase and Excel files.

The main difference between FoxPro and dBase is that the FoxPro functions use 
the Visual Fox Pro OLEDB driver, which is 32 bits only, and the dBase functions
use ACE, which comes in 32 bit and 64 bit distributions. There is a good chance
that the dBase functions will work perfectly on FoxPro-flavored dBase files, but
there has not been extensive testing.
